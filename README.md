# Golang & Directus Authentication Flow

## About This Project

This project is a personal exploration into building an authentication flow using Go in conjunction with Directus as the backend. It serves as a learning tool for understanding how to implement secure login mechanisms and manage user sessions.

### Objectives

- To learn how to integrate Go with Directus for user authentication.
- To understand the process of securing user login and registration.
- To explore best practices in managing user sessions and security tokens.

### Features

- User registration and login flow.
- Secure password handling and token generation.
- Interaction with Directus API for user management.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I aimed to gain a deeper understanding of:

- The Go programming language and its application in web development.
- Directus as a headless CMS and its API for user management.
- Security considerations in authentication flows, including password hashing and JWT handling.

## Disclaimer

This project is intended solely for my learning and is not meant as a production-ready solution. It showcases specific techniques and approaches in Go programming and Directus integration without focusing on comprehensive error handling or scalability concerns.

## Acknowledgements

- Directus for providing an extensive and flexible headless CMS.
- The Go programming community for resources and tools that facilitated this learning project.

### Future Aspirations

- **Extend Functionality**: I plan to expand the authentication flow to include features such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), password recovery, and email verification to enhance security and user experience.
- **Integration with Different Backends**: While this project uses Directus, I aim to explore how similar authentication flows can be implemented with other backends and databases, broadening my understanding of web development ecosystems.
- **Adaptation for Production**: Learning from this project, I intend to refine and adapt the authentication system for production use, ensuring it meets security standards and can scale with user growth.
